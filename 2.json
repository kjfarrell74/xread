He appears to be in a formal setting, possibly a hearing room or government building, with dark brown leather chairs visible in the background. Partially visible behind him is an American flag.  A portion of another person's face is visible in the lower right corner, also appearing light-skinned. At the bottom of the image is a Fox News graphic with the text \"'BIG BALLS' ROOTS OUT FRAUD & WASTE,\" the program name \"JESSE WATTERS PRIMETIME,\" and a time stamp \"5:31 PT\"."
